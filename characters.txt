Elara, a spirited young villager with bright eyes and untamed auburn hair, was known for her boundless curiosity and fearless heart. While exploring her late grandfather’s attic, she uncovered a weathered map glowing faintly with runes. With wonder sparking in her gaze, she knew an extraordinary adventure was about to begin.

Shadow, a sleek black wolf with silver-streaked fur and eyes like moonlight, had followed Elara since she rescued him as a pup. Fiercely loyal and silent as the wind, he was her guardian and guide through the forest’s depths. Where Elara went, Shadow was never far behind—watchful, brave, and true.
